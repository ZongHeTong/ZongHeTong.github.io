Learning, in the context of machine learning, describes an automatic search process for better representations.

All machine-learning algorithms consist of automatically finding such transformations 
that turn data into more-useful representations for a given task.

At machine learning the learning is mean: searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, 
using guidance from a feedback signal.

Deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning: a new take on learning representations from data that 
puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations.

At deep learning the learning is mean : finding a set of values for the weights of all layers in a network, such that
the network will correctly map example inputs to their associated targets.
